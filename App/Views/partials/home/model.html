            <h2>The Lifecycle of a Specification</h2>
            <p>Traditional documentation is static. A blog post from 2022 about deploying a MEVN stack might be
                dangerously out of date. At HttpStack, a specification is never "done." It lives, breathes, and
                hardens through a continuous, three-phase lifecycle powered by the developer community.</p>

                    <p>It starts with an idea. A developer proposes a unique combination of technologiesâ€”the
                        "stack."</p>

            <h2>Phase 1: Propose a Stack</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">Every great specification begins as a hypothesis. This is where you, the
                architect, define that hypothesis.</p>

            <h4>What is a "Stack Proposal"?</h4>
            <p>A proposal is the foundational act of defining a new technology combination within the HttpStack
                ecosystem. You aren't just listing tools; you are selecting a specific version of an **Element**
                (e.g., `PostgreSQL 16.1`) for each of the core architectural **Layers** (e.g., Database, Server OS,
                API Framework).</p>
            <p>Whether your stack is a time-tested workhorse like **LAMP** (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) or an
                unorthodox experiment like **FEVER** (FastAPI, EdgeDB, Vue, Edge Functions, Rust), the proposal
                process is the same. It stakes a flag in the ground and invites the community to explore its
                potential.</p>

            <h4>The Goal of This Phase</h4>
            <p>To create a clear, unambiguous definition of the stack's components, which becomes the blueprint for
                the specification that follows. A successful proposal creates a new, empty "spec document" ready to
                be filled in by the community.</p>

            <h2>Phase 2: Build the Specification via Q&amp;A</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">This is the core of HttpStack. We transform unstructured knowledge into a
                highly-structured, queryable database by asking the right questions.</p>

            <h4>Beyond the Tutorial</h4>
            <p>Instead of a single developer writing a monolithic "how-to" guide, the community builds the
                specification piece by piece. Our system generates hundreds of targeted questions for each stack,
                covering every layer of interaction:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Configuration:</strong> "What is the standard `nginx.conf` directive for proxying
                    requests to the Node.js server in this stack?"</li>
                <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> "Which version of the `pg` library for Node.js is confirmed
                    compatible with `PostgreSQL 16.1` under `Ubuntu 22.04`?"</li>
                <li><strong>Gotchas &amp;amp; Pitfalls:</strong> "Are there known memory leak issues when using this
                    specific caching library with this version of the API framework?"</li>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> "What is the typical request-per-second benchmark for the login
                    endpoint when the database layer is under moderate load?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Power of Atomic Knowledge</h4>
            <p>Each answer is a discrete, "atomic" piece of knowledge tagged to the specific elements and layers it
                concerns. This allows knowledge to be aggregated. An answer about configuring Nginx for a Node.js
                app contributes not only to the current stack's specification but also to the global knowledge base
                for Nginx and Node.js.</p>

            <h2>Phase 3: Verification and Validation</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">A specification is only a theory until it's proven in practice. Verification is
                the process of turning theory into fact.</p>

            <h4>What is a "Verification"?</h4>
            <p>A verification is a formal report submitted by a community member who has attempted to build and
                deploy the stack according to its specification. It's the ultimate form of peer review.</p>
            <p>To submit a verification, a user must provide evidence, which can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deployment Logs:</strong> Evidence of a successful build and run process.</li>
                <li><strong>Repository Links:</strong> A link to a public Git repository with a working
                    implementation.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Benchmarks:</strong> Screenshots or logs from tools like `ab` (Apache
                    Benchmark) or `k6` that validate performance claims.</li>
                <li><strong>Error Reports:</strong> Detailed reports of where the specification was inaccurate or
                    incomplete, helping to refine it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A verified specification is one that has been independently reproduced by other developers. It's a
                stamp of approval that says, "This works as described."</p>

            <h2>The Visual Language: Color Bands of Completeness</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">We translate the complex state of a specification into a simple, at-a-glance
                visual: the Stack Band.</p>

            <p>Each stack is represented by a horizontal band of colors, where each color corresponds to a specific
                architectural layer (e.g., <span class="color-swatch red"></span> Database, <span
                    class="color-swatch gray"></span> Server, <span class="color-swatch green"></span> API). The
                **opacity or "richness"** of each color tells you the story of its documentation:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Faint/Transparent:</strong> The specification for this layer is just beginning. Only a
                    few basic questions have been answered.</li>
                <li><strong>Semi-Opaque:</strong> The spec is well underway. Key configuration and setup questions
                    are answered.</li>
                <li><strong>Solid/Vibrant:</strong> The specification for this layer is comprehensive, covering edge
                    cases, performance tuning, and security.</li>
                <li><strong>Glowing/Highlighted Border:</strong> This layer has been successfully **verified** by at
                    least one other developer. It's battle-tested.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This system allows you to instantly assess the maturity and reliability of any stack in our ecosystem
                before you invest a single second in trying to build it.</p>
