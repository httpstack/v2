            <h2>From Ambiguity to Assembly: A New Standard for Stacks</h2>
            <p>In an era of endless technological choice, clarity is the most valuable commodity. HttpStack is more
                than a tool; it's a movement to standardize how we document, understand, and assemble the technology
                that powers the web. We're turning tribal knowledge into a living, community-driven specification.</p>

            <h3>The Philosophy: Why We Exist</h3>
            <p>For too long, the "right" way to build a stack has been a matter of opinion, experience, or blog posts.
                We believe in a more structured approach. Inspired by the WHATWG's success in creating a living standard
                for HTML, we aim to do the same for the entire application stack. Our goal is to provide developers with
                the insight to not only know *what* tools to use, but *why* and *how* they work together.</p>

            <h3>The 12 Layers of a Modern Stack</h3>
            <p>At the core of HttpStack is a comprehensive, 12-layer model of a full-stack application. This model
                provides a complete picture, from the user's device to the deepest infrastructure. Here’s the full
                breakdown:</p>

            <div class="feature-box">
                <h4>1. The Compatibility Score</h4>
                <p>When you select components for your stack, our system analyzes their interoperability based on
                    community data, best practices, and known integration challenges. It calculates a "Likelihood of
                    Working" score, flagging potential issues before you write a single line of code.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h4>2. Dynamic Documentation Generation</h4>
                <p>Once your stack is defined, we generate a complete, custom manual for it. This includes installation
                    commands, boilerplate configuration files, and a step-by-step workflow for deploying your specific
                    combination of tools. It’s your personalized roadmap from development to production.</p>

            <h2>Become a Specifier: The WHATWG for Stacks</h2>
            <p>A standard is only as strong as its community. We are calling on developers, engineers, and architects to
                become <strong>Specifiers</strong>. By contributing your expertise, documenting stacks, and validating
                compatibility data, you are not just helping others—you are actively building the industry standard.
                This is your chance to shape the future of web development.</p>
